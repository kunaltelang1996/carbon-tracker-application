1️⃣ User Stories

These are written in standard Agile format and grouped by feature.

Epic: User Account & Household Setup

US-1
As a user, I want to register an account so that my household data is stored securely.

US-2
As a user, I want to log in to the system so that I can access my household’s carbon data.

US-3
As a user, I want my data to be associated with a single household so that all appliance usage belongs to one place.

Epic: Appliance Management

US-4
As a user, I want to add household appliances with their power ratings so that emissions can be calculated accurately.

US-5
As a user, I want to view a list of my appliances so that I can manage them easily.

US-6
As a user, I want to update appliance details so that incorrect data can be fixed.

US-7
As a user, I want to delete appliances so that unused appliances do not affect my carbon calculations.

Epic: Appliance Usage Tracking

US-8
As a user, I want to log daily usage hours for each appliance so that my energy consumption is recorded.

US-9
As a user, I want to select the date for appliance usage so that I can log past usage.

US-10
As a user, I want the system to prevent invalid usage values so that data remains realistic.

US-11
As a user, I want to edit or delete usage entries so that mistakes can be corrected.

Epic: Carbon Emission Calculation

US-12
As a user, I want the system to calculate energy consumption automatically so that I do not need to do manual calculations.

US-13
As a user, I want the system to calculate carbon emissions based on energy usage so that I can understand my environmental impact.

US-14
As a user, I want emissions to be recalculated when usage data changes so that results stay accurate.

Epic: Emission Factor Configuration

US-15
As a user, I want the system to use a default emission factor so that I can get results without configuration.

US-16
As a user, I want to select my region so that emission calculations are more accurate.

Epic: Dashboard & Insights

US-17
As a user, I want to see today’s total carbon emissions so that I can track daily impact.

US-18
As a user, I want to see monthly emissions so that I can understand long-term trends.

US-19
As a user, I want to see emissions broken down by appliance so that I know which devices consume the most energy.

US-20
As a user, I want to view emission trends in charts so that data is easy to understand.

Epic: Reporting & Data Export

US-21
As a user, I want to export my carbon data so that I can analyze it externally.

US-22
As a user, I want summary statistics so that I can quickly understand my household’s footprint.

2️⃣ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

This is structured like a formal academic or industry SRS.

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the requirements for a Household Carbon Footprint Tracking Application. The application enables users to calculate, monitor, and analyze carbon emissions generated from household electricity consumption.

1.2 Scope

The system focuses on electricity-based carbon emissions produced by household appliances. It supports manual data entry and provides daily and monthly emission insights.

1.3 Definitions

kWh: Kilowatt-hour, unit of electrical energy

Emission Factor: CO₂ emitted per unit of electricity consumed

Household: A single residential unit tracked by one account

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

The application is a web-based system consisting of a Java Spring Boot backend and a React frontend. It follows a client-server architecture.

2.2 User Characteristics

Users are assumed to have basic familiarity with web applications. No technical expertise is required.

2.3 Operating Environment

Backend: Java, Spring Boot
